In particular, XML is not really one format so much as it is a meta-format with many dialects.  Syntactically, XML is a relatively simple format that defines elements with angle bracketed tags (less-than and greater-than signs), allows attributes within tags, and has a few other syntactic forms for special entities and directives.  As a rough approximation, XML is a generalization of HTML; or more accurately, HTML is a dialect of XML (to be pedantic, however, recent versions of HTML are not precisely XML dialects in some technical details).",
